# Tour of Heroes

* **Objective** - to build an app that helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes.
* **Purpose** - To gain familiarity with building angular applications
* **Description**
   * This app has many of the features you'd expect to find in a data-driven application.
   * This app acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.

## Part 0 - Clone the project
* Begin by _forking_ this project into a personal repository.
   * To do this, click the `Fork` button located at the top right of this page.
* Navigate to **your github profile** to find the _newly forked repository_.
* Clone the repository from **your account** into your `~/dev` directory.
* Open the newly cloned project in a code editor (IntelliJ, for example).


## Part 1 - Configure Local Environment Environment
* This setup guide uses the `npm` client command line interface, which is installed with `Node.js` by default. 
* Verify that your machine has [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed by
    1. open `node` by executing the following command from a command line
        * `node`
    2. update `node` by executing the following command from a command line
        * `npm install npm@latest -g`
* Install [Angular.js]() by executing the following command from a command line
    * `npm install -g @angular/cli`  
* If there are still issues with configuration, click [here](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) to see the full documentation on setting up local environment.


## Part 2 - Create a new workspace and initialize the project
* From the root directory of the project, execute the following command from a command line to create a new workspace and initial starter app
    *  `ng new my-app`
* `add`, `commit`, and `push`, your changes to your remote repository as an initial _checkpoint_ for the project.
